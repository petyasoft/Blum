Get API_AD and API_HASH in https://my.telegram.org/auth?to=apps and add them to the file config.py.
if you want to use Proxy, set USE_PROXY in config.py to True, otherwise False. If USE_PROXY=True open file proxy.txt and and using the example fill out the file. (Don't forget to clear extra lines)

<br>IMPORTANT</br>
With one api_ad and api_hash the software will work with all accounts, no need to change them for each account
